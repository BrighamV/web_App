# Overview

This is a simple calculator. It is a functional web application that can perform simple math calculations.
The main goal of this web app was to take a dive into learning django. I have worked on web apps before but
have never taken the django approach. This little app has taught me some of the basics regarding  django
templates and how it interacts with python and html files. 

This is a short demo of my web app.

# Web Pages

I have four pages. A homepage, calculate, answer and extra page. The homepage is just an introduction to the project
The calculate page has two input forms. One is for the simple math while the other is for more complicated math operations.
The two other pages are used to display the answer to the users input. One will display the simple math while the other is for
The more complex math. 

# Development Environment

Visual Studio code
virtual environment running python
django

# Future Work

* I could in the future put some style into this app so it looks cleaner.
* If I were to put the answer on the same page as the input I could use it as an input to build upon a previous calculation
* More math functions could be added to make a fully functioning calculator.
